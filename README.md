# open_ip_hosting_chat_application (incomplete, In progress)
an application that allows people to run a chat server, and also connect to other people's server to communicate on different channels.
currently, the networking is incomplete.

## setting up a server:
servers are currently only accessable from localhost and LAN connections. A port forwarding rule needs to be set up on the router in order for the server to exist on the internet. 
run "server.py" with a given ip and port to set it up. (currently withheld)

## setting up a client:
as long as a valid ip and port is provided, the client application is able to connect to any valid server (even through the internet)
