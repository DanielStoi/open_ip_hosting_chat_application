# open_ip_hosting_chat_application (In progress)
an application that allows people to run a chat server, and also connect to other people's server to communicate on different channels.

Currently, the server code is ommitted due to it being part of an assignment that is still being marked. Once marks are out, I have permission to put up the server code. It was coded from scratch.

The client code is all my independent creation.

## setting up a server: 
servers are currently only accessable from localhost and LAN connections. A port forwarding rule needs to be set up on the router in order for the server to exist on the internet. 
run "server.py" with a given ip and port to set it up. (currently withheld)

## setting up a client:
as long as a valid ip and port is provided, the client application is able to connect to any valid server (even through the internet)
